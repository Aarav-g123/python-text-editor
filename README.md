# Python Text Editor

This repository contains a simple, barebones text editor implemented in Python using the Tkinter library. This text editor allows you to create, open, edit, and save text files.

## Prerequisites

Before running the text editor, make sure you have Tkinter installed, which is a standard GUI library for Python. To check if Tkinter is installed, you can run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
python -m tkinter
```

If you don't see any errors and a GUI window opens up, Tkinter is installed and working.

If Tkinter is not installed, you can install it using the following command:

```bash
pip install tk
```

## Usage

1. Clone this repository to your local machine using `git clone`.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/python-text-editor.git
```

2. Change into the cloned directory.

```bash
cd python-text-editor
```

3. Run the Python script to launch the text editor.

```bash
python text-editor.py
```

## Features

- **New File:** Create a new untitled file with an empty text area.
- **Open File:** Open an existing text file and display its content in the text area.
- **Save:** Save the current content of the text area to the opened file.
- **Save As:** Save the content of the text area to a new file or overwrite an existing file.
- **Quit:** Close the text editor.

## Known Limitations

- The text editor is quite basic and lacks advanced features found in commercial text editors.
- Error handling is minimal, and certain edge cases might not be properly handled.
